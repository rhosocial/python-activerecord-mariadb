# Transaction Support

## Overview

rhosocial-activerecord provides a transaction manager that wraps MariaDB's transaction semantics. This section covers isolation levels, savepoints, and deadlock handling for the MariaDB backend.

## Transaction Manager

### Synchronous

```python
# Using the transaction manager
with User.transaction():
    user = User(username='alice')
    user.save()
    # Transaction commits on successful exit
    # Transaction rolls back on exception
```

### Asynchronous

```python
# Using the async transaction manager
async with User.transaction():
    user = User(username='alice')
    await user.save()
    # Transaction commits on successful exit
    # Transaction rolls back on exception
```

The transaction manager has both sync and async variants:
- `MariaDBTransactionManager` -- synchronous
- `AsyncMariaDBTransactionManager` -- asynchronous

The API is identical -- the only difference is `async with` vs `with`.
